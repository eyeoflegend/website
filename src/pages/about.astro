<p>Imagine a universe where ideas are the ultimate superpower.</p>

<p>In Reboot Division, a character's strength is literally based on a core concept—like "water" or "technology." Entire realms, collections of worlds, are locked in a cosmic struggle. The main players are the aggressive, fascist "Community" and the newer, resilient "Union."</p>

<p>The real kicker? There's a mysterious threat called "The Rebooted" that can essentially overwrite a person's existence. Earth, or "Terra," becomes a pivotal battleground because its people have "supercores," a kind of spiritual plot armor that makes them uniquely resistant to being Rebooted.</p>

<p>It's a cosmic war where the power of concepts can save—or shatter—reality itself.</p>
