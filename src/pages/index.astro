			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
			
<pre>Imagine a universe where ideas are the ultimate superpower.

In Reboot Division, a character's strength is literally based on a core concept‚Äîlike "water" or "technology." Entire realms, collections of worlds, are locked in a cosmic struggle. The main players are the aggressive, fascist "Community" and the newer, resilient "Union."

The real kicker? There's a mysterious threat called "The Rebooted" that can essentially overwrite a person's existence. Earth, or "Terra," becomes a pivotal battleground because its people have "supercores," a kind of spiritual plot armor that makes them uniquely resistant to being Rebooted.

It's a cosmic war where the power of concepts can save‚Äîor shatter‚Äîreality itself.</pre>
